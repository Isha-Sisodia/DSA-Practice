        left = 0
        right = len(s) - 1

# q1

    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1

    while left < right:
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]

print(s)

# Method - 2
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
print(s[::-1])

# Method - 3
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
s.reverse()
print(s)

# Method 4
#Using a loop + extra list
def reverseString(s):
    temp = ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
    s[:] = temp   #  modifies original list
s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
reverseString(s)
print(s)

#  Method 5: Recursion (NOT ideal)
